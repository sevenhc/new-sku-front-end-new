      policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We draw your attention to your following rights under data protection
        law
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      6.3.1 The law on data protection gives you certain rights in relation to
      the data we hold on you. These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the right to be informed. This means that we must tell you how we use
        your data, and this is the purpose of this privacy notice
      </li>
      <li>
        the right of access. You have the right to access the data that we hold
        on you
      </li>
      <li>
        the right for any inaccuracies to be corrected. If any data that we hold
        about you is incomplete or inaccurate, you are able to require us to
        correct it
      </li>
      <li>
        the right to have information deleted. If you would like us to stop
        processing your data, you have the right to ask us to delete it from our

        processing it
      </li>

        the right to restrict the processing of the data. For example, if you
        believe the data we hold is incorrect, we will stop processing the data

      </li>
      <li>
        the right to portability. You may transfer the data that we hold on you

      </li>
      <li>
        the right to regulate any automated decision-making and profiling of
        personal data. You have a right not to be subject to automated decision
        making in way that adversely affects your legal rights
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      6.4 You have a right not to be subject to automated decision making in any
      way that adversely affects your legal rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.5 Where you have provided consent to our use of your data, you also have
      the unrestricted right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing
      your consent means that we will stop processing the data that you had
      previously given us consent to use. There will be no consequences for
      withdrawing your consent. However, in some cases, we may continue to use
      the data where so permitted by having a legitimate reason for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
      exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee
      if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
      Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please contact us using the details in section 1 of this notice if you
      would like to exercise any of these rights or know more about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rights are subject to certain limitations that exist in law. Further
      information about your information rights is available on the ICO's
      website:<a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank"

    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px">
      7. Where we store your personal information and for how long
    </p>
    <p>
      7.1 The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored
      at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also
      be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one
      of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the
      provision of support services. In such cases, to safeguard your privacy
      rights, transfers will be made to recipients to which a European
      Commission "adequacy decision" applies (this is a decision from the
      European Commission confirming that adequate safeguards are in place in
      that location for the protection of personal data), or will be carried out
      under standard contractual clauses that have been approved by the European
      Commission as providing appropriate safeguards for international personal
      data transfers, or by the adoption of EU-US Privacy Shield. By submitting
      your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We
      will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is
      treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.2 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which
      enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for
      keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password
      with anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.3 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
      completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
      data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our
      site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your
      information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to
      prevent unauthorised access.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.4 We carefully consider the personal data that we store, and we will not
      keep your information in a form that identifies you for longer than is
      necessary for the purposes set out in this policy or as required by
      applicable law. In some instances, we are required to hold data for
      minimum periods: for example, UK tax law currently specifies a six-year
      period for retention of some of your personal data.
